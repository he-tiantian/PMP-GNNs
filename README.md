# PMP-GNNs
A baseline implementation of Polarized message-passing graph neural networks that is published in Artificial Intelligence, 2024.

Requirements:
Python (>=3.8)
PyTorch (>=1.9.0)
DGL (>=0.9.1)

Please unzip data.zip before running the python files in the corresponding folders.

As there are no pre/post process or early stopping control and different GPU/CUDA platforms might be used, the performances might slightly change.
